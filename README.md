# Small-Scale & Resilient IaaS Cloud with OpenStack

Welcome to the repository the peer-reviewed paper: "Design of a Small-Scale and Failure-Resistant IaaS Cloud Using OpenStack". üìù

## Abstract

In today's cloud-driven world, public cloud giants like AWS, Azure, and Google offer seamless experiences for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). However, there are scenarios where a smaller, private cloud is the optimal choice, whether it's due to cost considerations or the need for greater data control.

The paper explores the fascinating realm of designing a small-scale and failure-resistant IaaS cloud with OpenStack. Discover how OpenStack can empower you to replicate the seamless experience of public clouds on a smaller, more cost-effective scale while retaining full control over your data.

Explore the paper for insights into making cloud infrastructure more accessible and efficient. Whether you're a cloud administrator or simply curious about cloud technologies, this repository is your gateway to a more resilient cloud future. ‚öôÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è
