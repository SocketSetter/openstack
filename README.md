## About the Paper

**Title:** Small-Scale and Failure-Resistant IaaS Cloud Using OpenStack

**Abstract:**
Major public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, or Google, offer seamless experiences for infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). With the emergence of the public cloudâ€™s vast usage, administrators must be able to have a reliable method to provide the seamless experience that a public cloud offers on a smaller scale, such as a private cloud. When a smaller deployment or a private cloud is needed, OpenStack can meet the goals without increasing cost or sacrificing data control.
